/*
* Grid Class:
*   This class holds a 2D array of Tile pointers that make up the map. Each Tile pointer
*   represents a coordinate on the map (x,z). We use z because we want the map to be parallel to 
*   the "ground". The pointer points to a Tile object which occupies that space (note that tiles
*   can be more than a single coordinate big).
