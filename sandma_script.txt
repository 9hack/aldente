a little of bit lore


Story shit
	(Why are we in this fucking dungeon? What is the goal? Why arewe so antagonistic towards each other? We are children.)
Tutorial shit
	Allow me to instruct you in the ways of this realm.
	How to play the game
	Goal of the game
	Sequence of play
Hidden Lore shit
	Be the first (or of the first) to reach the exit to receive a hefty cache of dream essence. Each dream essence bringing you one step closer escaping this eternal nightmare.
	Dead children.
	Why have I not a flickering reflection in this realm? I've been hearing many a voice in dreamspace.
	Dreams are the shadow-truths that will endure when mere facts are dust and ashes, and forgot.
	Let's feast on the flesh of mine enemies, the Pastamancers of Siltgourd!... just kidding :)
