  {"smile_sandma.png", "You see, dream essences can be physically manifested, sculpted"
  " into the realm."},
  {"fufu_sandma.png", "Expend essences wisely. You could, for example, invest in a sealed"

  {"smile_sandma.png", "Spend your time wisely too. There's only a limited amount of"
  " sculpting time."},
  {"fufu_sandma.png", "Now, let's go!"},

// Dungeon
{
  {"fufu_sandma.png", "What a wonderful imagination you must have! These creations are incredibly"

  " have created, trying to accrue as much dream essence as possible."},
  {"smile_sandma.png", "Of course, to make things a bit more fun, there's a portal that will"
  " materialize in a random location after 30 seconds have passed."},
  {"smile_sandma.png", "First one to the portal gets even more dream essence!"},
  {"disappoint_sandma.png", "Just try not to lose it all to other children..."},

  {"fufu_sandma.png", "Here comes something which should really get your heart racing!"
  " Who doesn't love a good sport, after all?"},
  {"smile_sandma.png", "Now, you will compete against the other children to earn a healthy"
  " smattering of that dream essence I know you love."},
  {"fufu_sandma.png", "Then, you can sculpt even more creations, and gain the most dream essence of"
  " them all!"},
  {"disappoint_sandma.png", "...You're asking why you're gathering dream essence in the first place?"},
  {"angry_sandma.png", "You needn't concern yourself with it now."},
  {"smile_sandma.png", "Just know that you'll be happiest if you have the most."},
  {"fufu_sandma.png", "Now go forth and claim first place!"},
  {"fufu_sandma.png", "........."},
  {"smile_sandma.png", "Ah, I forgot to mention, I won't be seeing you for awhile."},
  {"smile_sandma.png", "You'll be doing some more sculpting, exploring, and sporting."
  " Four more times, to be exact."},
  {"fufu_sandma.png", "I'll see you again after that, so don't miss me too much!"},
}

// Win
{
  {"smile_sandma.png", "Congratulations, my child, you've won the right to awaken."},
  {"fufu_sandma.png", "Enjoy it while it lasts..."},

// Lose
{
  {"angry_sandma.png", "I'm sorry my child, you've lost. I'm afraid you have no right to"
  " awaken."},

Story shit
	(Why are we in this fucking dungeon? What is the goal? Why arewe so antagonistic towards each other? We are children.)
Tutorial shit
	Allow me to instruct you in the ways of this realm.
	How to play the game
	Goal of the game
	Sequence of play
Hidden Lore shit
	Be the first (or of the first) to reach the exit to receive a hefty cache of dream essence. Each dream essence bringing you one step closer escaping this eternal nightmare.
	Dead children.
	Why have I not a flickering reflection in this realm? I've been hearing many a voice in dreamspace.
	Dreams are the shadow-truths that will endure when mere facts are dust and ashes, and forgot.
	Let's feast on the flesh of mine enemies, the Pastamancers of Siltgourd!... just kidding :)
